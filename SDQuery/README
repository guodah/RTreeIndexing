Before running the example, make sure that 
1. rtree.jar and security.policy are in the same folder.
2. You have some feed items in that folder as well

To run the example:
Step 0: enter the directory where rtree.jar and security.policy are stored.

Step 1: start an rmi registry: 
	* "start rmiregistry -J-Djava.rmi.server.useCodebaseOnly=false" in Windows
	* "rmiregistry -J-Djava.rmi.server.useCodebaseOnly=false" in Linux
	
Step 2: start the rmi agent by running the following command
	* java -cp path_to/rtree.jar -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=file:/path_to/rtree.jar -Djava.security.policy=security.policy com.geofeedia.networks.RMIAgent
	* Note: you need to spell out the path to rtree.jar for "java.rmi.server.codebase" even if rtree.jar is in the working directory
	
Step 3: run the text datum loader by running the following command
	* java -cp rtree.jar com.geofeedia.rtree.client.TextBasicDatumLoader feeditems_#########.txt unicode
	
Notes:
1. it will take a while if there are many feeditems 
2. While or after the program is running, a folder named "rmi_leaves" will be created. It stores all the leaves which exists in CSV format.
